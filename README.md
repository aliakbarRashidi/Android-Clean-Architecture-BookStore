A sample android application built based on principles of Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture as described [here](http://vimeo.com/43612849). Some of the code inspiration comes from this [awesome article](http://fernandocejas.com/2014/09/03/architecting-android-the-clean-way/) and [github repo](https://github.com/android10/Android-CleanArchitecture).

WORK IN PROGRESS!
